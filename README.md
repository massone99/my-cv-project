# My Computer Vision Project

This is a computer vision project that uses Jupyter Notebook for model training, testing, and evaluation. The project uses various Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy. 

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `notebooks/main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook where the computer vision models are trained, tested, and evaluated.
- `data`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the computer vision models.
- `models`: Directory for storing the trained computer vision models.
- `scripts`: Directory containing Python scripts used in the Jupyter notebook.
- `README.md`: The documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. This will train the computer vision models using the data in the `data` directory and save the trained models in the `models` directory.
2. You can modify the scripts in the `scripts` directory as needed.
